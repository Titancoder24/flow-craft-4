# Vercel Deployment

The app is now ready for Vercel deployment with a hardcoded API key.

## Current API Key:

The app uses a hardcoded API key: `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`

## How to Deploy:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Import your GitHub repository (`flow-craft-4`)
3. Vercel will auto-detect it's a React app
4. Click "Deploy" - no environment variables needed!

## Important Notes:

- **Hardcoded API key** - No environment variables required
- **Ready to deploy** - Works immediately on Vercel
- **Simple setup** - Just import and deploy
- **Production ready** - All dependencies included
